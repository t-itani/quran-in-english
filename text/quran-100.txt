By the panting chargers.
By the igniters of sparks.
By the raiders at dawn.
Raising clouds of dust.
Storming into the midst.
The human being is ungrateful to his Lord.
And he bears witness to that.
And he is fierce in his love of good things.
Does he not know? When the graves’ contents are scattered around.
And the hearts’ contents are retrieved.
On that Day, their Lord is fully informed of them.
