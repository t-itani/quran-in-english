By the fig and the olive.
And Mount Sinai.
And this secure land.
We created the human being in the best design.
Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low.
Except those who believe and do good deedsâ€”they will have an unending reward.
So what makes you deny the religion?
Is God not the Wisest of Judges?
