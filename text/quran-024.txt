A chapter that We revealed, and made obligatory, and revealed in it Clear Verses, so that you may take notice.
The adulteress and the adulterer: whip each one of them a hundred lashes. And let no pity towards them overcome you regarding God’s Law—if you believe in God and the Last Day. And let their punishment be witnessed by a group of believers.
The adulterer shall marry none but an adulteress or an idolatress. And the adulteress shall marry none but an adulterer or an idolater. That is prohibited for believers.
As for those who accuse chaste women, and do not produce four witnesses, whip them eighty lashes. And never accept any testimony from them—these are the immoral.
Except those who repent afterward and reform—God is Forgiving and Merciful.
As for those who accuse their own wives, but have no witnesses except themselves, the testimony of one of them is equivalent to four testimonies, if he swears by God that he is truthful.
And the fifth time: that God’s curse be upon him: if he is a liar.
But the punishment shall be averted from her, if she swears four times by God, that he is a liar.
And the fifth time: that God’s wrath be upon her: if he is truthful.
Were it not for God’s favor upon you, and His mercy, and that God is Acceptor of repentance and Wise.
Those who perpetrated the slander were a bunch of you. Do not consider it bad for you, but it is good for you. Each person among them bears his share in the sin. As for him who played the major role: for him is a terrible punishment.
If only, when you heard it, the believing men and believing women thought well of one another, and said, “This is an obvious lie.”
Why did they not produce four witnesses? If they do not produce the witnesses, then in God’s sight, they are liars.
Were it not for God’s grace upon you, and His mercy, in this world and the Hereafter, you would have suffered a great punishment for what you ventured into.
When you passed it from one tongue to another, and you said with your mouths what you had no knowledge of, and you considered it trivial, but according to God, it is very serious.
If only, upon hearing it, you said, “It is not for us to repeat this. Glory be to You, this is a heinous slander.”
God cautions you never to return to the like of it—if you are believers.
God explains the Revelations to you. God is Knowing and Wise.
Those who love to see immorality spread among the believers—for them is a painful punishment, in this life and in the Hereafter. And God knows, and you do not know.
Were it not for God’s grace upon you, and His mercy, and that God is Clement and Merciful.
O you who believe! Do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Whoever follows Satan’s footsteps—he advocates indecency and wickedness. Were it not for God’s favor towards you, and His mercy, none of you would be pure, ever. But God purifies whom He wills. God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.
Those among you who possess affluence and means should not refuse to give to the relatives, and the needy, and the emigrants in God’s way. And let them pardon. And let them overlook. Do you not love for God to forgive you? God is Pardoning and Merciful.
Those who slander honorable, innocent, believing women are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter. And they will have a terrible punishment.
On the Day when their tongues, and their hands, and their feet will testify against them regarding what they used to do.
On that Day, God will pay them their just due in full, and they will know that God is the Evident Reality.
Wicked women are for wicked men, and wicked men are for wicked women, and good women are for good men, and good men are for good women. These are acquitted of what they say. They will have forgiveness and a generous provision.
O you who believe! Do not enter houses other than your own, until you have asked for permission, and greeted their occupants. That is better for you; so that you may remember.
And if you find no one in them, do not enter them until you are given permission. And if it is said to you, “Turn back,” then turn back. That is more proper for you. God is aware of what you do.
There is no blame on you for entering public places, in which is something of benefit for you. God knows what you disclose and what you conceal.
Tell the believing men to restrain their looks, and to guard their privates. That is purer for them. God is Aware of what they do.
And tell the believing women to restrain their looks, and to guard their privates, and not display their beauty except what is apparent thereof, and to draw their coverings over their breasts, and not expose their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their fellow women, what their right hands possess, their male attendants who have no sexual desires, or children who are unaware of women’s nudity. And they should not strike their feet, drawing attention to their hidden beauty. And turn to God in repentance, all together, O believers, so that you may be successful.
And wed those who are single among you. And those who are fit among your servants and maids. If they are poor, God will enrich them from His bounty. God is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.
And let those who cannot marry abstain, until God enriches them from His bounty. If any of your servants wish to be freed, grant them their wish, if you recognize goodness in them. And give them of God’s wealth, which he has given you. And do not compel your girls to prostitution, seeking the materials of this life, while they desire to remain chaste. Should anyone compel them—then after their compulsion, God is Forgiving and Merciful.
We revealed to you clarifying revelations, along with examples of those who passed on before you, and advice for the righteous.
God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His light is that of a niche, in which is a lamp. The lamp is within a crystal. The crystal is like a brilliant planet, fueled by a blessed tree, an olive tree, neither eastern nor western. Its oil would almost illuminate, even if no fire has touched it. Light upon Light. God guides to His light whom He wills. And God presents the parables to the people. And God knows everything.
In houses that God has permitted to be raised, and His name is celebrated there. He is glorified there, morning and evening.
By men who neither trade nor commerce distracts them from the remembrance of God, and from performing the prayers, and from giving charity. They fear a Day when hearts and sights are overturned.
So that God may reward them according to the best of what they did, and increase them from His bounty. God provides for whom He wills without measure.
As for those who disbelieve: their works are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty imagines it as water. Until, when he has reached it, he finds it to be nothing, and he finds God with him, Who settles his account in full. God is quick in accounting.
Or like utter darkness in a vast ocean, covered by waves, above which are waves, above which is fog—darknesses, one above the other. If he brings out his hand, he can hardly see it. He to whom God has not granted a light has no light.
Do you not realize that God is glorified by whoever is in the heavens and on earth, even by the birds in formation? Each knows its manner of prayer and praise. God knows what they do.
To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and to God is the final return.
Do you not see how God propels the clouds, then He joins them together, then He piles them into a heap, and you see raindrops pouring from its midst? How He brings down from the sky loads of hail, striking with it whom He wills, and averting it from whom He wills? The flash of its lightning nearly snatches the sight away.
God alternates the night and the day. Surely in this is a lesson for people of insight.
And God created every living creature from water. Some of them crawl on their bellies, and some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. God creates whatever He wills. God is Capable of everything.
We sent down enlightening revelations, and God guides whom He wills to a straight path.
And they say, “We have believed in God and in the Messenger, and we obey.” Then some of them turn away thereafter. These are not believers.
And when they are invited to God and His Messenger, to judge between them, some of them suddenly turn away.
But if justice is on their side, they accept it willingly.
Is there a sickness in their hearts? Or are they suspicious? Or do they fear that God may do them an injustice? Or His Messenger? In fact, they themselves are the unjust.
The only response of the believers, when they are invited to God and His Messenger, to judge between them, is to say, “We hear and we obey.” It is they who are the achievers.
Whoever obeys God and His Messenger, and fears God and is conscious of Him—these are the winners.
And they swear by God with their most solemn oaths: if you were to command them, they would mobilize. Say, “Do not swear; obedience will be recognized; God is experienced with what you do.”
Say, “Obey God and obey the Messenger.” But if they turn away, then he is responsible for his obligations, and you are responsible for your obligations. But if you obey him, you will be guided. It is only incumbent on the Messenger to deliver the Message clearly.
God has promised those among you who believe and do good deeds, that He will make them successors on earth, as He made those before them successors, and He will strengthen their religion for them—which He has approved for them—and He will substitute security in place of their fear. They worship Me, associating nothing with Me. But whoever disbelieves thereafter—these are the rebellious.
And pray regularly, and give charity regularly, and obey the Messenger, so that you may receive mercy.
Never think that those who disbelieve can escape on earth. Their housing is the Fire: a miserable destination.
O you who believe! Permission must be requested by your servants and those of you who have not reached puberty. On three occasions: before the Dawn Prayer, and at noon when you change your clothes, and after the Evening Prayer. These are three occasions of privacy for you. At other times, it is not wrong for you or them to intermingle with one another. God thus clarifies the revelations for you. God is Aware and Wise.
When the children among you reach puberty, they must ask permission, as those before them asked permission. God thus clarifies His revelations for you. God is Knowledgeable and Wise.
Women past the age of childbearing, who have no desire for marriage, commit no wrong by taking off their outer clothing, provided they do not flaunt their charm. But to maintain modesty is better for them. God is Hearing and Knowing.
There is no blame on the blind, nor any blame on the disabled, nor any blame on the sick, nor on yourselves for eating at your homes, or your fathers’ homes, or your mothers’ homes, or your brothers’ homes, or your sisters’ homes, or the homes of your paternal uncles, or the homes of your paternal aunts, or the homes of your maternal uncles, or the homes of your maternal aunts, or those in your trust, or your friend’s. You commit no wrong by eating together or separately. But when you enter any home, greet one another with a greeting from God, blessed and good. Thus God explains the revelations for you, so that you may understand.
The believers are those who believe in God and His Messenger, and when they are with him for a matter of common interest, they do not leave until they have asked him for permission. Those who ask your permission are those who believe in God and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission to attend to some affair of theirs, give permission to any of them you wish, and ask God to forgive them. God is Forgiving and Merciful.
Do not address the Messenger, in the same manner, you address one another. God knows those of you who slip away using flimsy excuses. So let those who oppose his orders beware, lest an ordeal strikes them, or a painful punishment befalls them.
Know that to God belongs everything in the heavens and on earth. He knows what you stand for. And on the day they are returned to Him, He will inform them of what they did. God has full knowledge of all things.
