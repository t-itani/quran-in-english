He frowned and turned away.
Because the blind man came to him.
But how do you know? Perhaps he was seeking to purify himself.
Or be reminded, and the message would benefit him.
But as for him who was indifferent.
You gave him your attention.
Though you are not liable if he does not purify himself.
But as for him who came to you seeking.
In awe.
To him you were inattentive.
Do not. This is a Lesson.
So whoever wills, shall take notice from it.
In honorable pages.
Elevated and purified.
By the hands of scribes.
Noble and virtuous.
Perish the human being! How ungrateful he is!
From what thing did He create him?
From a drop He created him. Then He proportioned him.
Then He eased the way for him.
Then He puts him to death, and He buries him.
Then, whenever He wills, He will resurrect him.
But no, he did not fulfill what He commanded him.
Let the human being look at his food.
How We pour down water in abundance.
Then crack the soil open.
And grow in it grains.
And grapes and herbs.
And olives and dates.
And luscious gardens.
And fruits and vegetables.
As sustenance for you and for your livestock.
But when the Deafening Blast comes to pass.
The Day when a person will flee from his brother.
And his mother and his father.
And his spouse and his children.
Every one of them, on that Day, will have enough to preoccupy him.
Faces on that Day will be radiant.
Laughing and rejoicing.
And faces on that Day will be covered with dust.
Covered by darkness.
These are the faithless, the vicious.
