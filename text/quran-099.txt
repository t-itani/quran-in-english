When the earth is shaken with its quake.
And the earth brings out its loads.
And the human being says, “What is the matter with it?”
On that Day, it will convey its chronicles.
Because your Lord will have inspired it.
On that Day, the people will emerge in droves, to be shown their works.
Whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it.
And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it.
