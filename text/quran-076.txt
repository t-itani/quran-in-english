Has there come upon the human being a span of time when he was nothing to be mentioned?
We created the human being from a drop of mixed fluid, to test him; and We made him hearing and seeing.
We guided him to the way, be he appreciative or unappreciative.
We have prepared for the disbelievers chains, and yokes, and a Searing Fire.
But the righteous will drink from a cup mixed with aroma.
A spring from which God’s servants will drink, making it gush abundantly.
They fulfill their vows, and they dread a Day whose ill is widespread.
And they feed, for the love of Him, the poor, the orphan, and the prisoner.
“We feed you only for God’s sake. We desire from you neither compensation nor gratitude.
We dread from our Lord a frowning, grim Day.”
So God will shield them from the horror of that Day, and He will grant them radiance and joy.
And He will reward them, for having been patient, with a Garden and silk.
Reclining in it on the couches; experiencing in it neither sun nor bitter cold.
Its shade hovering over them, and its fruit brought low within reach.
Circulating among them are vessels of silver, and cups of crystal.
Crystalline silver—they measured them precisely.
And they will be given a drink flavored with ginger.
From a spring there, named Salsabeel.
Passing among them are eternalized youths. If you saw them, you would think them sprinkled pearls.
If you look, and look, you will see bliss and a vast kingdom.
Upon them are garments of green silk and satin. And they will be decorated with silver bracelets. And their Lord will offer them a pure drink.
“This is a reward for you. Your efforts are well appreciated.”
It is We who sent down the Quran upon you—a gradual revelation.
So be patient with your Lord’s judgment. And obey among them neither sinner nor disbeliever.
And mention the Name of your Lord, morning and evening.
And during the night, prostrate to Him, and glorify Him long into the night.
As for these: they love the transient, and they leave behind a Heavy Day.
We created them, and We strengthened their frames. And whenever We will, We will replace them with others like them.
This is a reminder; so whoever wills, let him take a path to his Lord.
Yet you cannot will—unless God wills. God is Knowing and Wise.
He admits into His mercy whomever He wills. But as for the wrongdoers, He has prepared for them a painful punishment.
