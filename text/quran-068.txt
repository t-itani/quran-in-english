Nuun. By the pen, and by what they write.
By the grace of your Lord, you are not insane.
In fact, you will have an unending reward.
And you are of a great moral character.
You will see, and they will see.
Which of you is the afflicted.
Your Lord knows best who has strayed from His path, and He knows best the well-guided.
So do not obey the deniers.
They wish that you would compromise, so they would compromise.
And do not obey any vile swearer.
Backbiter, spreader of slander.
Preventer of good, transgressor, sinful.
Rude and fake besides.
Just because he has money and children.
When Our Verses are recited to him, he says, “Myths of the ancients!”
We will mark him on the snout.
We tested them, as We tested the owners of the garden—when they vowed to harvest it in the morning.
And they made no exception.
But a disaster from your Lord went around it while they slept.
And it became as if picked.
In the morning, they called one another.
“Go early to your plantation, if you want to harvest.”
So they set out, whispering to one another.
“No poor person is to enter it upon you today.”
And they proceeded early, resolved in intent.
But when they saw it, they said, “We are lost.
In fact, we are deprived.”
The most moderate of them said, “Did I not say to you, ‘if only you would praise?’”
They said, “Glory be to our Lord—We were in the wrong.”
Then they turned to one another, blaming one another.
They said, “Woe to us—we were domineering.
Perhaps our Lord will give us a better substitute for it. We are turning to our Lord in hope .”
Such is the punishment. But the punishment of the Hereafter is greater—if they only knew.
For the righteous are Gardens of Delight with their Lord.
Shall We treat the submitters like the villains?
What is the matter with you? How do you judge?
Or do you have a scripture in which you study?
That you will have in it whatever you choose?
Or do you have oaths from Us, binding until Resurrection Day, that whatever you demand is yours?
Ask them, which of them will guarantee that!
Or do they have partners? Then let them bring their partners—if they are truthful.
On the Day when the Shin will be exposed, and they will be called to bow down, but they will be unable.
Their eyes subdued, covered with shame. They were invited to prostrate when they were sound.
So leave Me to those who reject this message. We will proceed against them gradually, from where they do not know.
And I will give them time. My plan is firm.
Or are you asking them for a fee, so they are burdened with debt?
Or do they know the future, and so they write it down?
So be patient with your Lord’s Judgment. And do not be like the Fellow of the Whale who cried out in despair.
Had the blessing from his Lord not reached him, he would have been thrown onto the barren shore, and he was blamed.
But his Lord chose him, and He made him of the righteous.
Those who disbelieve almost stab you with their glances when they hear the message, and they say, “He is crazy!”
But it is only a reminder for humankind.
