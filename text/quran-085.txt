By the sky full of constellations.
And by the Promised Day.
And by the witness and the witnessed.
Destroyed were the People of the Trench.
The fire supplied with fuel.
While they sat around it.
And were witnessing what they were doing to the believers.
They took vengeance on them only because they believed in God the Almighty, the Praised.
He to Whom belongs sovereignty over the heavens and the earth. And God is witness over everything.
Those who persecute believing men and believing women, then do not repent: for them is the punishment of Hell, and for them is the punishment of Burning.
Those who believe and do righteous deeds will have Gardens beneath which rivers flow: that is the supreme triumph.
The onslaught of your Lord is severe.
It is He who begins and repeats.
And He is the Forgiving, the Loving.
Owner of the Glorious Throne.
Doer of whatever He wills.
Has the story of the legions reached you?
Of Pharaoh and Thamood?
In fact, those who disbelieve are in denial.
But God encloses them from beyond.
In fact, it is a Glorious Quran.
In a Preserved Tablet.
