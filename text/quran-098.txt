A messenger from God reciting purified scriptures.
Containing valuable writings.
Those who were given the Scripture did not splinter, until after the Clear Evidence came to them.

Those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture and the Polytheists will be in the Fire of Hell, remaining in it forever. These are the worst of creatures.
As for those who believe and do good works—these are the best of creatures.
Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, remaining in them forever. God is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. That is for whoever fears His Lord.
