Exalted is He in whose hand lies sovereignty, and He has power over all things.
He who created death and life—to test you—which of you is best in conduct. He is the Almighty, the Forgiving.
He who created seven universes in layers. You see no discrepancy in the creation of the Compassionate. Look again. Can you see any cracks?
Then look again, and again, and your sight will return to you dazzled and exhausted.
And We have beautified the lower heaven with lanterns, and We made them missiles against the devils, and We have prepared for them the suffering of the Blaze.
For those who reject their Lord: there is the torment of Hell, a miserable destination.
When they are thrown into it, they will hear it roaring, as it seethes.
It almost bursts with fury. Every time a batch is thrown into it, its keepers will ask them, “Did not a warner come to you?”
They will say, “Yes, a warner did come to us, but we denied, and said, ‘God did not send anything down; you are very much mistaken.’”
And they will say, “Had we listened or reasoned, we would not be among the inmates of the Blaze.”
So they will acknowledge their sins. So away with the residents of the Blaze.
As for those who fear their Lord unseen—for them is forgiveness and a great reward.
Whether you keep your thoughts secret, or you declare them—He is Aware of the inner thoughts.
Would He not know, He Who created? He is the Subtle, the Expert.
It is He who made the earth manageable for you. So travel its regions, and eat from His provision. And to Him is the Resurgence.
Do you feel secure that He Who is in heaven will not cause the earth to collapse beneath you while it spins?
Or do you feel secure that He Who is in heaven will not unleash against you a violent storm? Then you will know what My warning is like.
Those before them also denied. So how was My disapproval?
Or have they not seen the birds above them, spreading their wings, and folding them? None holds them except the Compassionate. He is Perceiver of all things.
Or who can be a force to protect you other than the Merciful? The unbelievers are in nothing but delusion.
Or who is he who will provide for you, if He withholds His provision? Yet they persist in defiance and aversion.
Is he who walks bent on his own design better guided, or he who walks upright on a straight path?
Say, “It is He who produced you; and made for you the hearing, and the vision, and the organs. But rarely do you give thanks.”
Say, “It is He who scattered you on earth. And to Him, you will be gathered.”
And they say, “When will this promise be fulfilled—if  you are truthful?”
Say, “Knowledge is with God, and I am only a clear warner.”
But when they see it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieved will turn gloomy, and it will be said, “This is what you used to call for.”
Say, “Have you considered? Should God destroy me and those with me, or else bestows His mercy on us, who will protect the disbelievers from an agonizing punishment?”
Say, “He is the Mercy-Giver. In Him, we believe, and in Him we trust. And you will soon know who is clearly astray.”
Say, “Have you considered? If your water drains away, who could bring you pure running water?”
