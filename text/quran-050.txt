Qaf. By the Glorious Quran.
They marveled that a warner has come to them from among them. The disbelievers say, “This is something strange.
When we have died and become dust? This is a farfetched return.”
We know what the earth consumes of them, and with Us is a comprehensive book.
But they denied the truth when it has come to them, so they are in a state of confusion.
Have they not observed the sky above them: how We constructed it and decorated it, and it has no cracks?
And the earth, how We spread it out, and We set mountains on it, and We made every beautiful pair grow in it?
An observation and a reminder for every repenting worshiper.
And We sent down from the sky blessed water, and We grew with it gardens and grains for harvest.
And the soaring palms, with layered clusters.
As sustenance for the servants. And We revive with it a dead land. Likewise is the emergence.
Before them, the people of Noah denied, as did the dwellers of Russ, and Thamood.
And Aad, and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot.
And the Woods-Dwellers, and the people of Tubba. They all rejected the messengers, so My threat was justly fulfilled.
Were We fatigued by the first creation? But they are in doubt about a new creation.
We created the human being, and We know what his soul whispers to him. We are closer to him than his jugular vein.
As the two receivers receive, seated to the right and to the left.
Not a word does he utter, without an observer beside him ready.
And the daze of death has come in truth: “This is what you were trying to evade.”
And the Trumpet is blown: “This is the Promised Day.”
And every soul comes, with it a driver and a witness.
“You were negligent of this, so We lifted your screen from you, and your vision today is sharp.”
And His escort will say, “This is what I have ready.”
“Throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever.
Preventer of good, aggressor, doubter.
Who fabricated another god with God; so toss him into the intense agony.”
His escort will say, “Our Lord, I did not make him rebel, but he was far astray.”
He will say, “Do not feud in My presence—I have warned you in advance.
The word will not be changed with Me, and I am not unjust to the servants.”
On the Day when We say to Hell, “Are you full?” And it says, “Are there any more?”
And Paradise will be brought near for the righteous—not far away.
“This is what you were promised—for every careful penitent.
Who inwardly feared the Compassionate, and came with a repentant heart.
Enter it in peace. This is the Day of Eternity.”
In it, they will have whatever they desire—and with Us is even more.
How many generations before them did We destroy, who were more powerful than they? They explored the lands—was there any escape?
In this is a reminder for whoever possesses a heart, or cares to listen and witness.
We created the heavens and the earth and everything between them in six stages, and no fatigue touched Us.
So endure what they say, and proclaim the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before sunset.
And glorify Him during the night, and after the prostrations.
And listen for the Day when the Caller calls from a nearby place.
On the Day when they hear the Shout in Truth. This is the Day of Emergence.
It is We Who give life and cause death. And to Us, is the destination.
The Day when the earth breaks open from them quickly. That is an easy gathering for Us.
We are fully aware of what they say, and you are not a dictator over them. So remind with the Quran whoever fears My warning.
