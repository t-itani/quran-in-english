Ha. Meem.
By the Enlightening Scripture.
We revealed it on a Blessed Night—We have been warning.
In it, every wise command is made distinct.
A command from Us. We have been sending messages.
As mercy from your Lord. He is the Hearer, the Knower.
Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything between them, if you are certain.
There is no god except He. He gives life, and He causes death. Your Lord and Lord of your earliest ancestors.
Yet they play around in doubt.
So watch for the Day when the sky produces a visible smoke.
Enveloping humanity. This is a painful punishment.
“Our Lord, lift the suffering from us, we are believers.”
How can there be a reminder for them, and an enlightening messenger has come to them.
But they turned away from him, and said, “Educated, but crazy.”
We will postpone the punishment for a while, but you will return.
On the Day when We launch the Great Assault—We will avenge.
We tested the people of Pharaoh before them: a noble messenger came to them.
“Hand over the servants of God to me. I am a trustworthy messenger to you.”
And, “Do not exalt yourselves above God. I come to you with clear authority.
And I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord, lest you condemn me.
But if you do not believe in me, then keep away from me.”
Then he then appealed to his Lord: “These are guilty people.”
“Set out with My servants by night—you will be followed.
And cross the sea quickly—they are an army to be drowned.”
How many gardens and fountains did they leave behind?
And plantations, and splendid residences.
And luxuries they used to enjoy.
So it was. And We passed it on to another people.
Neither heaven nor earth wept over them, nor were they delayed.
And We saved the Children of Israel from the humiliating persecution.
From Pharaoh. He was a tyrant, a transgressor.
And We chose them knowingly over all people.
And We gave them many signs in which was an obvious trial.
Yet these say:
“There is nothing beyond our first death, and we will not be resurrected.
Bring back our ancestors, if you are truthful.”
Are they better, or the people of Tubba and those before them? We annihilated them. They were guilty.
We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them in play.
We only created them for a purpose, but most of them do not know.
The Day of Sorting Out is the time appointed for all.
The Day when no friend will avail a friend in any way, and they will not be helped.
Except those on whom God has mercy. He is the Powerful, the Merciful.
The Tree of Bitterness.
The food of the sinful.
Like molten lead—boiling inside the bellies.
Like the boiling of seething water.
Seize him and drag him into the depths of Hell.
Then pour over his head the suffering of the Inferno.
Taste! You who were powerful and noble.
This is what you used to doubt.
But the righteous will be in a secure place.
Amid Gardens and springs.
Dressed in fine silk and rich brocade, facing one another.
So it will be. And We will pair them with lovely companions.
In it, they call for every fruit, in serenity.
They will taste no death in it, except the first death. And He will protect them from the suffering of the Blaze.
A grace from your Lord. That is the ultimate success.
We made it easy in your language, so that they may remember.
So be on the watch. They too are on the watch.
