Praise the Name of your Lord, the Most High.
He who creates and regulates.
He who measures and guides.
He who produces the pasture.
Then reduces it to light debris.
We will make you read, so do not forget.
Except what God wills. He knows what is declared, and what is hidden.
We will facilitate for you the Way of Ease.
So remind, if the reminder is beneficial.
He who fears will take notice.
But the most wretched will avoid it.
He who will enter the Gigantic Fire.
Where he will neither die, nor live.
Successful is he who purifies himself.
And remembers the Name of his Lord, and prays.
But you prefer the present life.
Even though the Hereafter is better and more lasting.
This is in the earlier scriptures.
The Scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
