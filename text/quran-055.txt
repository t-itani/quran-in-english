The Compassionate.
Has taught the Quran.
He created the human being.
And taught him clear expression.
The sun and the moon—by calculations.
And the stars and the trees prostrate.
And the sky, He raised. And He set up the balance.
So do not transgress in the balance.
But maintain the weights with justice. And do not violate the balance.
And the earth—He set it up for the creatures.
In it are fruits and date-palms in clusters.
And grains in the blades, and fragrant plants.
