When the sky breaks apart.
When the planets are scattered.
When the oceans are exploded.
When the graves are tossed around.
Every soul will know what it has advanced, and what it has deferred.
O, man! What deluded you concerning your Lord, the Most Generous?
He Who created you, and formed you, and proportioned you.
In whatever form He willed, He assembled you.
But you reject the religion.
Although there are guardians over you.
Honest recorders.
They know everything you do.
The righteous will be in bliss.
And the wicked will be in Hell.
They will enter it on Judgment Day.
And they will not be absent from it.
And what will make you realize what Judgment Day is?
Then again, what will make you realize what Judgment Day is?
The Day when no soul will avail another soul whatsoever—and all authority on that Day is God’s.
