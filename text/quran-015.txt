We sent messengers before you, to the former communities.
Yet no messenger came to them, but they ridiculed him.
Thus We slip it into the hearts of the guilty.

And the jinn, We created before, from scorching fire.

He said, “It is not for me to prostrate to a human whom You created from clay, from molded mud.”
He said, “Then get out of here, for you are an outcast.”

They said, “We bring you good news in truth—so do not despair.”
He said, “And who despairs of his Lord’s mercy, except those who are astray?”
He said, “So what is your mission, O envoys?”

“Except for his wife.” We have determined that she will be among those who lag behind.”
And when the envoys came to Lot’s family.
He said, “You are a people unknown to me.”
They said, “We bring you what they used to doubt.”
“And we come to you with the truth, and we are truthful.”

We have given you seven of the pairs, and the Grand Quran.
Do not extend your eyes towards what We have bestowed on some classes of them to enjoy, nor grieve over them; and lower your wing to the believers.
And say, “I am the clear warner.”
Just as We sent down to the separatists.
Those who made the Quran obsolete.

About what they used to do.
So proclaim openly what you are commanded, and turn away from the associators.
We are enough for you against the mockers.
Those who set up another god with God. They will come to know.
We are aware that your heart is distressed by what they say.
So glorify the praises of your Lord, and be among those who prostrate.
And worship your Lord until you attain certainty.
