Their eyes downcast, they will emerge from the graves, as if they were swarming locusts.
Scrambling towards the Caller. The unbelievers will say, “This is a difficult Day.”

We are sending the female camel as a test for them. So watch them, and be patient.
And inform them that the water is to be divided among them—each share of drink equitably proportioned.

So how were My punishment and My warnings?
We sent against them a single Scream, and they were like crushed hay.

Or do they say, “We are united, and we will be victorious”?
The multitude will be defeated, and they will turn their backs.
The Hour is their appointed time—the Hour is most catastrophic and most bitter.
The guilty are in confusion and madness.
On the Day when they are dragged into the Fire on their faces: “Taste the touch of Saqar.”
Everything We created is in precise measure.
And Our command is only once, like the blink of an eye.
And We have destroyed the likes of you. Is there anyone who would ponder?
Everything they have done is in the Records.
Everything, small and big, is written down.
The righteous will be amidst Gardens and rivers.
In an assembly of truth, in the presence of an Omnipotent King.
