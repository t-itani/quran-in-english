O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, divorce them during their period of purity—and calculate their term. And reverence God, your Lord. And do not expel them from their homes, nor shall they leave, unless they have committed a proven indecency. These are the limits set by God. Whoever oversteps the limits set by God has wronged his own soul. You never know; God may afterward bring about a new situation.
Once they have reached their term, either retain them nicely or separate from them nicely. And call to witness two just people from among you. And give upright testimony for God. By this is exhorted whoever believes in God and the Last Day. And whoever reverences God: He will make a way out for him.
And will provide for him from where he never expected. Whoever relies on God: He is enough for him. God fulfills His Will. God has set a measure for all things.
As for your women who have reached menopause: if you have any doubts, their term shall be three months—as well as for those who are yet to menstruate. As for those who are pregnant: their term shall be until they have delivered. Whoever is conscious of God: He will make things easy for him.
That is the command of God, which He has revealed to you. Whoever is mindful of God: He will remit his sins, and will amplify his reward.
Let them reside where you reside, according to your means. And do not harm them to pressure them. And if they are pregnant, then spend on them until they have delivered. And if they nurse for you, compensate them fairly. And maintain your relationship in amity. And if you have difficulty with one another, then let another woman nurse for him.
The wealthy shall spend according to his means. As for the one with limited resources, let him spend according to what God has given him. God never burdens a soul beyond what He has given it. God will bring ease after hardship.
How many a society rebelled against the commandments of its Lord and His messengers? So We held it strictly accountable, and We subjected it to a dreadful punishment.
So it tasted the bad consequences of its decisions, and the outcome of its decisions was perdition.
God has prepared for them a severe punishment. So beware of God, O you who possess intellect and have believed. God has revealed to you a Reminder.
A messenger reciting to you the Clear Verses of God, to bring those who believe and work righteousness from darkness into light. Whoever believes in God and acts with integrity, He will admit him into Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to stay there forever. God has given him an excellent provision.
God is He Who created seven heavens, and from the earth the like thereof. The command descends through them, so you may know that God is capable of everything, and that God has encompassed everything in knowledge.
