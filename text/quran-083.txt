Woe to the defrauders.
Those who, when they take a measure from people, demand in full.
But when they measure or weigh to others, they cheat.
Do these not know that they will be resurrected?
For a Tremendous Day?
The Day when Humankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds?
Not at all. The record of the wicked is in Sijjeen.
And what will make you realize what Sijjeen is?
A numerical book.
Woe on that Day to the deniers.
Those who deny the Day of Reckoning.
But none denies it except the sinful aggressor.
When Our Verses are read to him, he says, “Legends of the ancients.”
But no! Their hearts have become corroded by what they used to commit.
Undoubtedly, on that Day, they will be screened from their Lord.
Then they will roast in the Blaze.
Then it will be said, “This is what you used to deny.”
No indeed. The record of the righteous is in Elliyyeen.
And what will make you realize what Elliyyoon is?
A numerical book.
Witnessed by those brought near.
Surely, the virtuous will be in bliss.
On luxurious furnishings, gazing around.
You will recognize on their faces the radiance of bliss.
They will be given to drink of pure sealed wine.
Its seal is musk—this is what competitors should compete for.
And its mixture is of Tasneem.
A spring from which those brought near drink.
Those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed.
And when they passed by them, they would wink at one another.
And when they returned to their families, they would return joyfully.
And when they saw them, they would say, “These people are lost.”
Although they were not sent as guardians over them.
But on that Day, those who believed will laugh at the unbelievers.
On luxurious furnishings, looking on.
Have the unbelievers been repaid for what they used to do?
