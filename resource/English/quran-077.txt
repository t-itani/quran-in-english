By those sent in succession.
And those storming turbulently.
And those scattering far and wide.
And those separating decisively.
And those delivering a message.
Excusing or warning.
What you are promised will surely happen.
When the stars are blotted out.
And the sky is fractured.
And the mountains are blown away.
And the messengers are alerted.
Until which Day was it postponed?
Until the Day of Division.
And what will make you realize what the Day of Division is?
Woe on that Day to the liars.
Did We not destroy the ancients?
Then succeeded them with the others?
Thus We deal with the guilty.
Woe on that Day to the deniers.
Did We not create you from a base fluid?
Then lodged it in a secure place?
For a known term?
And We measured. How excellently We measure.
Woe on that Day to the falsifiers.
Did We not make the earth a homestead?
For the living and the dead?
And We placed on it lofty mountains, and We gave you fresh water to drink?
Woe on that Day to the rejecters.
“Proceed to what you used to deny.”
“Proceed to a threefold shadow.”
That provides no shade, nor avails against the flames.
It shoots sparks like castles.
As if they are yellow camels.
Woe on that Day to the liars.
This is a Day when they will not speak.
And they will not be permitted to offer excuses.
Woe on that Day to the falsifiers.
This is the Day of Separation. We have gathered you, together with the ancients.
So if you have a scheme, then scheme against Me!
Woe on that Day to the falsifiers.
The reverent will be amidst shades and springs.
And fruits such as they desire.
“Eat and drink pleasantly, for what you used to do.”
Thus We reward the virtuous.
Woe on that Day to the deniers.
“Eat and enjoy yourselves a little; you are guilty.”
Woe on that Day to the liars.
And when it is said to them, “Bow down,” they do not bow down.
Woe on that Day to the deniers.
So in what message, beyond this, will they believe?
